# Design Patterns in JavaScript

### ABSTRACTION
- Hide the details of the implementation from the user of the class and only expose the functionality to the user of the class.

### ENCAPSULATION
- The bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. (classes)

### INHERITANCE
- The procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.

### POLYMORPHISM
- The ability of an object to take on many forms.

## 2-SOLID-design-principles
1 Single responsibility principle
> every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility
